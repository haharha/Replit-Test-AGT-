// 1. Filter concerns rated 4 or 5 (high severity)
// 2. Map concerns to relevant PDFs using this linkage:

const concernToPdfMap = {
  1: ["Academic Learning", "5 Essential Skills", "Mastering 5 Components EQ"],
  2: ["Academic Learning", "Brain Development Stages", "Artistic Potential"],
  3: ["Loneliness in Children", "Mastering 5 Components EQ"],
  4: ["Mastering 5 Components EQ", "Hyperthymic Temperament"],
  5: ["Academic Learning", "Low Focus: Poor Memory vs ADHD"],
  6: ["Loneliness in Children", "20 Art Prompts EQ"],
  7: ["Brain Development Stages", "5 Essential Skills"],
  8: ["Parenting Like a Pro", "Brain Development Stages"],
  9: ["Academic Learning", "Low Focus: Poor Memory vs ADHD"],
  10: ["Preventing Diabetes (DHDT)", "Brain Development Stages"], // Health weighted higher
  11: ["Preventing Diabetes (DHDT)"], // Health weighted higher
  12: ["Brain Development Stages", "From Newborn to One"],
  13: ["Brain Development Stages", "Preventing Diabetes (DHDT)"],
  14: ["Brain Development Stages", "From Newborn to One"]
};

// 3. Weight health concerns (10-14) 1.5x higher
// 4. Count PDF frequency across high-severity concerns
// 5. Return top 3 most relevant PDFs
// 6. If ties, prioritize: Health > Emotional > Academic
